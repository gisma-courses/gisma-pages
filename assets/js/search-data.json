            "content": "Planning your Survey . It is very important that you plan your flight area with a suitable and sufficient overlap, otherwise no reliable results can be obtained with statistical stitching. If the overlap is too small, or conversely too large, you will get poor or no results. The overlap is centrally dependent on the flight altitude and the camera parameters as well as the acquisition frame rate. Some empirical low budget camera parameters are listed below. . Ground Resolution of typical cameras . ASL Alt m | GP8MP3+ (cm) | GP12MP3+ (cm) | DJI P3 4K (cm) | MAPIR 2 . (cm) . | . 15 | 1,08 | 0,9 | 0,63 | 0.56 | . 30 | 2,16 | 1,8 | 1,27 | 1,03 | . 75 | 5,4 | 4,5 | 3,2 | 2,53 | . 100 | 7,2 | 6,0 | 4,25 | 3,38 | . Suggested Overlap . Front Overlap 80%, Side Overlap 60% . Camera Speed . Depending on the product and manufactor of the cameras you have to deal with different speeds. Note: only the speed that can be continously achieved is taken into account. Currently a picture rate of 2 sconds is the maximum. . It is strongly recommended that you use (if available) the autonoumous camera timer for controlling the take of pictures. . Flight Speed . On average the fasted SD Cards will be able to achieve an average speed of about 2 seconds/JPEG (Raw + JPEG 3.5 seconds) image. As a result taking pictures every 2 seconds will be a sporty attempt. The Flight speed recommodations are meeting this needs. Let us assume you fly a task with the field of view (FOV) of the DJI 4K camera at 35 meters above level (agl). To derive the maximum flight distance from picture to picture in meter for the given overlap you have to calculate: . FOV*agl*(1-overlap) = 1,71*35*0,2 = 12 m . If you can take every 2 seconds a picture your max speed is: 12 m / 2 s = 6 m/s . Rule of thumb . For JPG pictures: 0,15 * agl (RAW; 0,07 * agl) . For a 100 meter AGL flight you should set the speed to a maximum of: . 0,15 * 100 = 15 m/s (54 km/h). . For a flight of 35 m agl this is will be roughly 5,25 m/s . Additional Data . If you fly in an wide open flat area you do not need additional data. But if you fly in middle range mountains,forests or similar complex structures you will need a digtal surface model (DSM/DEM) for retrieving an optimal flight path. Actually you also should check the weather – . no flying with Beaufort &gt; 3 it‘s a uav not the falcon. . Workflow .
